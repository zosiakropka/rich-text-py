# Rich Text for Python

**Rich Text for Python** is a Python port of the [Rich Text][richtext_github]
JavaScript library implementing format for representing rich text documents
and changes.

For more info I strongly recommend reading original lib's ``README.md`` file.

## Tests

For now, not whole the library is covered with unit tests (which is wrong, no
doubt about it). It's gotta change.

To run tests, issue:

```
python -m unittest test
```

To run tests for specific ``module``, issue:

```
python -m unittest test.test_<module>
```
